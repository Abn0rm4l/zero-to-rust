#+title: Zero To Rust
#+description: A guide on how to set up an environment and editor for rust development.
* Environment Setup
** Install Rust and Cargo
We'll install both using [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]].

[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html][Installation - The Cargo Book]]

#+begin_src sh
  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
#+end_src

* Editor Setup
** Neovim
There are many ways to setup [[https://neovim.io/][neovim]] this is merely one. If you know your way around, then feel free to get your own setup in place.

*** Install Neovim
[[https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md]]

#+begin_src sh
  brew install neovim
#+end_src

*** Configure Neovim
We will be using a pre-configured NeoVim setup called [[https://www.lazyvim.org/][LazyVim]].

Follow the installation instructions. [[https://www.lazyvim.org/installation][üõ†Ô∏è Installation | LazyVim]]

Once the config has been installed, install the two Extras packages useful for Rust.
Run the ~LazyExtras~ command (Press ~:~ in normal mode to run a command), find the extras and press ~x~.
- ~lang.rust~
- ~test.core~

Have a look at the default keymaps for LazyVim.
[[https://www.lazyvim.org/keymaps][‚å®Ô∏è Keymaps | LazyVim]]

*** Install dependencies
To get testing working properly we'll need to install [[https://nexte.st/][Cargo-Nextest]].

First install [[https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall][cargo-binstall]].

#+begin_src sh
  cargo install cargo-binstall
#+end_src

Then cargo-nextest.
#+begin_src sh
  cargo binstall cargo-nextest --secure
#+end_src

** VSCode
*** Install VSCode
Install [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][Visual Studio Code]] or [[https://vscodium.com/][VSCodium]] (VSCode minus all the Microsoft telemetry).

#+begin_src sh
  brew install --cask vscodium
#+end_src

OR

#+begin_src sh
  brew install --cask visual-studio-code
#+end_src

*** Install Plugins
We'll only need the one for now; ~rust-analyzer~.

* Tutorial Project
We'll build a small CLI application to get the feel for development in Rust.

** Create your crate
Cargo can create a new workspace for us and populate some of the basic files.

#+begin_src sh
  cargo new kanye
#+end_src
